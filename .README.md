## 🌐 Live Demo

🚀 **Deployed Application:**
👉 [https://elevator-entrapment-prediction.onrender.com](https://elevator-entrapment-prediction.onrender.com)

The application is fully hosted on Render and performs:

* Real-time sensor simulation
* Live LSTM inference
* Risk visualization dashboard
* Automatic logging

## 🚀 Project Overview

Elevator safety is mission-critical. Instead of reacting after failure, this system:

* Continuously monitors elevator signals
* Learns patterns using **LSTM time-series deep learning**
* Estimates **risk probability in real time**
* Shows alerts through an interactive dashboard

### Risk Levels

```
0 – 40   → SAFE  
40 – 70  → CHANCE TO RISK  
70 – 100 → UNDER RISK
```

## 📊 Model Concept

* Sequence Length → 10
* Input Features → 8
* Custom Loss → Focal Loss
* Output → Probability Score

This is a **predictive advisory system**, not a deterministic fault detector.

## 📊 Model Metrics Explanation
1.What Are We Measuring?

The model predicts a risk probability (0–1) that represents the chance of elevator entrapment based on the last 10 time steps of sensor data.

Instead of simple accuracy, we focus on:

How well the model detects risky situations.
How early it can identify failure patterns.
How reliable the probability score is.

2.Why LSTM Instead of Normal ML?

Traditional models see:

only current row
no time behavior

LSTM learns:

vibration increasing slowly
temperature rising pattern
repeated door retries
👉 Entrapment is a sequence problem, not a single value problem.

3.Custom Loss Function

Used Focal Loss instead of normal Cross-Entropy because:

Risk cases are rare
Model must focus more on difficult samples
Reduces bias toward SAFE class

4.Sample Result Interpretation

If model predicts:

0.82 → UNDER RISK → immediate inspection
0.55 → CHANCE TO RISK → monitor closely
0.18 → SAFE → normal operation

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Time-series deep learning
* Industrial AI design
* Real-time visualization
* Cloud deployment
* Safety-oriented ML
